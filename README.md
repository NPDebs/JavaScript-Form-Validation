A form built with basic HTML markup and styled with CSS. To create an account, the user must provide his/her username, email and password (obviously).
The magic is created with our beloved JavaScript! Conditional statements ensure the user details meet certain requirements before the form can be selected.
If the details are incorrect (or nonexistent), the input field turns red. The previously-hidden exclamation icon and error message appear (and turn red for dramatic effect, of course)!
If all conditions are met, the user receives a greenlight and is permitted to submit the form.
See for yourself!
